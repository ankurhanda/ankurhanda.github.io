Using 3D camera tracking as our test problem, and analysing a fundamental dense whole image alignment approach, we open up a route to a systematic investigation via the careful synthesis of photorealistic video using ray-tracing of a detailed 3D scene, experimentally obtained photometric response and
noise models, and rapid camera motions.

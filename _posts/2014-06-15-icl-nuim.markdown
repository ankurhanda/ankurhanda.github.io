We introduce the Imperial College London and National University of Ireland Maynooth (ICL-NUIM) dataset for the evaluation of visual odometry, 3D reconstruction and SLAM algorithms that typically use RGB-D data. We present a collection of handheld RGB-D camera sequences within synthetically generated environments. RGB-D sequences with perfect ground truth poses are provided as well as a ground truth surface model that enables a method of quantitatively
evaluating the final map or surface reconstruction accuracy.

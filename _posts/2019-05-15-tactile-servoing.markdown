In this paper, we specifically address the challenge of tactile servoing, _i.e._ given the current tactile sensing and a target/goal tactile sensing -- memorized from a successful task execution in the past -- what is the action that will bring the current tactile sensing to move closer towards the target tactile sensing at the next time step.
